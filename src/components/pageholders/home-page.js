In 2020, leadership recognized a concerning drop off in membership starts & retention.

              <p className="w-full">
                When Plast Canada Ukrainian Youth Scouting's summer camps were abruptly cancelled in May of 2020, kids (and already burnt-out parents) suddenly found themselves with a lot of time to spare. As a lifetime member and volunteer of Plast, I was brought on in a professional (design/development/consulting) capacity to assist a small but very dedicated team in end-to-end delivery of a then-undefined "summer experience" for our scouts all across Canada (and a few elsewhere, too!)</p>
                <p class="w-full">With very tight timelines and limited resources, product decisions were tough and swift - but with a solid vision established at the start, I was able to help the team clarify direction and build that into a clean, delightful, and very well-received online activity hub full of awesome activities and content!  </p>
                <p className="w-full">From program ideation all the way through to building a Gatsby/Prismic/Tailwind app, we worked together to ship a self-directed, household-inclusive online hub that successfully got families (somewhat paradoxically) off their screens, learning together, and making the best of an uncertain situation.

              <p class="w-full">
              PagerDuty is a digital operations management platform that notifies and deploys the right teams (IT Teams, primarily) at the right time to solve and prevent IT incidents. Recognizing the benefit of notifying responders as-directly-as-possible, PagerDuty invested in updating and improving its integrations for Slack and Microsoft Teams, the two preeminent workplace communications "chat platforms."

              <p class="w-full">
              Working with enterprise clients and being able to focus on design research and execution alone allowed me to truly deepen and expand my skillset in a variety of design tools and methodologies, as well as recognize my affinity for the Product Design field. My technical skillset enabled big efficiencies in the prototying and design process of this highly technical, API-driven product area, as well as contribute to the development (and React library) of PagerDuty's design system in the process.

              <p class="w-full">
              Brought on as a contract UX Designer mid-way through a redesign of PDâ€™s Slack Integration, my contributions in UX research, design and building of features led to a very successful release of improvements for our Slack integration. Verifying our learnings with crafty analytics gave us tremendous insight in developing complete design documentation for the forthcoming Microsoft Teams integration, and even pointed the way toward new core product features.

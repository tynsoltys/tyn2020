              <h3>Information Design & Architecture</h3>
              <p>I've come to learn that I have one of those handy 3D brains that thinks in colour coded matrices and enjoys grappling with very complex problems and technical architecture, and translating the abstract into tangible interfaces through the developer, configuration, and end-user layers. While I appreciate a good-looking product, I'm far more passionate about well-executed and seamless logic, and helping designers and developers understand their critical relationship to one another. </p>

              <h3>High Fidelity Prototyping</h3>
              <p>As a rockstar CSS stylist and pretty decent JS wrangler, I <em>could</em> design-build a fair portion of a modern web app singlehandedly. However, my true motivation lies in delivering and refining awesome end user experiences through experimentation.  With bonus skills like real-time code editing, understanding APIs, oAuth, docs and other technical stuff, I'm comfortable interfacing with clients, devs, product folk and search engines. From lowest-of-the-low-fi prototypes, all the way through to repos that get cloned by the devs, my coding skills allow me to bring ideas to life rapidly and with far less friction and process than a typical hi-fi design workflow. Plus I'm quite comfortable going into github and adding 3px of margin-top to that awkwardly positioned icon without needing to make a whole QA ticket about it.</p>

              <h3>Design Systems ðŸ”¥</h3>
              <p>As someone who has spent plenty of time on both sides of the fence, I'm thoroughly seasoned in negotiating designer dreams with developer realities (often through conversations with myself). From knowing which questions to ask, to establishing requirements, to having thoroughly explored my component library and usage documentation fantasies, I'm deeply empathetic with all users of this important UX moment. When decision fatigue and confusion are minimized in the upstream process, it's often the case that efficiency, quality, ownership, cooperation, and creativity shine through to create a reflexively seamless end product.</p>

              <h3>Product Semiotics</h3>
              <p>At the intersection of information design, branding, and design systems, lie the fundamental principles of good UX: clarity, familiarity, and consistent usage of symbols, colours, and interaction patterns to create intuitive, usable, and understandable products. Whether its conducting colour contrast audits, assembling icon inventories, or running word association exercises, putting real thought behind small details has a big impact on the visceral, subconscious user experience that elevate a product from usable to magical. </p>
